# Credits

After 1.2 *Chris* coded many changes under the supervision of *RickyTan* and *Kendo* with the contribution of *Toshi* and *Tucks* for porting and templates.

After 1.7.6 *Sparker* and *Jeroen* continued because the 1.7 bugs weren't possible to be fixed unless changing a lot of the code. 

*Stef* started supervising since 1.7.17 with great help of *IrLED* who started the github project and coded major core fixes and improvement such as proportional distribution of AI to headlessclients,lightened spawned script etc.

*Triada* adapted the mission for multi-language translation updating Stringtable.xml and harmonizing hints and task display. He translated, with support of Russian community, the mission to Russian. Also, *Nemesti* added the Spanish translation.

*Stef*, Wurzel0701 and Zalexki continued the develop branch untill Barbolani released the current A3-Antistasi

# Mods

The mission has no dependencies, however it can detect the following mods.
* **CBA**, **TFAR**, RHS-**AFRF**+**GREF**(replace AAF, CSAT), RHS-**USAF**(replace NATO), **ACE**.

Client side mods, as long they don't affect AI, are generally ok. Here's some suggestions
